# Changelog

## v0.2.0 (unreleased)

Repository restructure and an arm64 host-build fix. **No Lean API, auditor rule, gate, red-team
expectation or safety check changed.** Lean module names (`Janus.*`, `JanusTests.*`, `Oracle.*`) are
unchanged; consumers need no source edits. See `docs/MIGRATION.md` ("v0.1 to v0.2") and
`Structure/README.md`.

- New layout: `models/{asl,x86}` (was `JanusASL/`, `JanusX86/`), `validation/` (was `oracle*/` and
  `Oracle/`, organised as `hardware-comparison/`, `reference-models/`, `model-runner/`),
  `test/lean` (was `JanusTests*`), `test/redteam` (was `audit/`, rounds under `rounds/`),
  `scripts/{gate,build,verify,validation,dev,archive}`, `docs/{design,audit,validation,dev-notes,assets}`.
  History is preserved (`git mv`). One-shot generators (`jx1_*`, `jx2_*`, `break-demo.sh`,
  `incr-sample.py`) moved to `scripts/archive/`.
- `Janus.lean`, `Janus/`, `framework.go`, `identity_sentinel.*`, `go.mod`, `go.sum`, `lakefile.toml`,
  `lake-manifest.json`, `lean-toolchain` stay at the root (Lake modules and `go:embed`).
- `janus` now builds for linux/arm64 hosts: `blockers_amd64.go` / `sweep_amd64_test.go` lost their
  `_amd64` file-name suffix (now `blockers_x86.go`, `sweep_x86_test.go`).
- The verifier identity changes (embedded sources moved), so result and framework caches rebuild once.
- The validation Go modules are renamed to their directories
  (`github.com/Giulio2002/Janus/validation/hardware-comparison/{arm64,amd64}`).
- Added `Structure/README.md` (repository map) and this changelog. Removed the stray `.x1` / `.x2`.

## v0.1.0

First tagged release (tag `v0.1.0`, commit `77054be0`): Lean framework and `janus` CLI for formally
verifying compiled Go machine code (arm64, amd64).

- Mandatory non-vacuity witnesses: a returning run from a state satisfying the precondition, a
  call-site state for every runtime-contract hypothesis, strict by-name pairing, anchoring for
  Panics/Faults/Traps conclusions; narrow, labelled exemptions for refutations and run-free statements.
- Hermetic proof sandbox: allowlist root, environment allowlist, hidden cache keys, fds above 2 closed.
- `verify-batch` with witness companions and stale-report withdrawal; speed batch 14; provenance fix.
- ~840 pinned red-team expectations; trust model in `docs/SOUNDNESS.md`.
- Known limitations: a witness shows some run returns, not that every contract call site is reachable
  on it (KA1); main theorems with class-typed binders cannot be witnessed; red-team controls N45/N53
  are rejected conservatively; accepted sandbox nondeterminism: clock, random bytes, uid, host
  `/proc/{cpuinfo,meminfo,loadavg}`.
- Not shipped: linux/arm64 host binaries (fixed in v0.2.0).
